Key Compatibility Factors and Adjustments

Generally, modern web extensions are designed to be quite portable between Chrome and Firefox. This is largely due to the WebExtensions API, which both browsers support.  However, there are still some potential differences to be aware of.

Manifest Version:

Your manifest uses manifest_version: 3. Both Chrome and Firefox support Manifest V3, which is excellent. This is the most significant compatibility hurdle overcome.
Permissions:

"contextMenus", "activeTab", "scripting", "storage": These permissions are generally supported by both browsers. You're likely fine here.
Background Script:

"background": { "service_worker": "background.js" }: Chrome uses service_worker for background scripts in Manifest V3. Firefox also supports service_worker, which is the modern standard, ensuring compatibility.
Content Scripts:

"content_scripts": [ { "matches": ["<all_urls>"], "js": ["saveit.js"] } ]: This structure is standard and should work in Firefox without changes. <all_urls> is accepted by both.
Browser Action / Action:

"action": { "default_popup": "about.html", ... }: Chrome uses action in Manifest V3, which is the standardized version of browser_action. Firefox also uses action, so this is correct.
Icons:

The icon paths should work fine as long as the image files are included in your extension package and the paths are relative and correct.
Commands:

"commands": { ... }: Keyboard shortcuts defined in commands are generally well-supported in both browsers.
Potential Snags and Things to Test

Minor API Differences: While the core WebExtensions APIs are the same, subtle differences can exist. It's crucial to test every function your extension uses (e.g., chrome.contextMenus vs. browser.contextMenus (the more cross-browser way), chrome.storage vs. browser.storage) to ensure identical behavior. Firefox recommends using the browser namespace for better compatibility.
Asynchronous Operations: Pay close attention to how you handle asynchronous operations (Promises, callbacks). Subtle timing differences between browsers can sometimes expose issues.
UI Rendering: Ensure your about.html and any other UI elements render correctly in Firefox. CSS and HTML can sometimes have minor inconsistencies.
Context Menu Behavior: Context menu behavior (when they appear, what they contain) should be tested thoroughly, as there can be slight variations.
File Paths: Double-check file paths within your extension to ensure they are relative and work correctly in both browsers.
Debugging: Familiarize yourself with Firefox's extension debugging tools. They are similar to Chrome's but have their own nuances.
Steps to Adapt and Test

Namespace Update (Recommended): In your JavaScript files (background.js, saveit.js, etc.), replace chrome. with browser. where applicable.  This promotes better cross-browser compatibility.  For example:

JavaScript

// Instead of:
// chrome.storage.sync.get(['key'], function(data) { ... });

// Use:
browser.storage.sync.get(['key']).then(data => { ... });
Firefox Manifest Validation: Firefox is generally more strict about manifest validation.  Double-check your manifest.json against Firefox's documentation to ensure it adheres to their requirements.  There might be slight variations in allowed keys or formats.

Testing in Firefox:

Temporary Add-on Loading: In Firefox, you can temporarily load your extension for testing without packaging it. Go to about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox and load the directory containing your extension files.
Debugging Tools: Use Firefox's developer tools to inspect the background scripts, content scripts, and UI of your extension. Pay attention to any errors or warnings in the console.
Packaging for Firefox: When you're ready to distribute, Firefox requires extensions to be packaged as .xpi files.  There are tools and methods to create these packages.
